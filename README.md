# minejson
Convert your solo world's stats/advancements to JSON ✨

## How it works?
- Download node.js and the project. 
- Run Terminal Application (like command prompt/powershell)
- Go to the project folder on Terminal
- Just choose which folder is your need!
- `cd stats` for stats json converter and `cd advancements` for advancement json converter
- Copy your old account's and new account's json to that folder! 
⚠️ Don't change the name of the original data json* we'll need that later! (*it is your player UUID, don't change it)
